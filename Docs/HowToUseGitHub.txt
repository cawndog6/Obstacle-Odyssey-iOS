How to use GitHub With Unity in a Team:

1) Open GitHub Desktop and select your personal branch in the current branch section. 
2) Select Fetch Origin.
3) Select Branch up top and then select update from master.
4) Keep doing step 3 until you see a confirmation that the master has been merged into your branch.
	-You now have the master branch version!
5) Create your features while your personal branch is selected and commit all your changes to that branch.
6) Select Branch and then create pull request.
7) This is an attempt to merge into the master branch and must be approved by another member.
8) Once master is updated, everyone should start from step 1 again to remain on the same page.

Side Notes:
- If multiple people are working at the same time, stay in a discord call to make sure you aren't both changing the same objects as one version will be overwritten when pull requests are approved.
- Brandon, Josh, and Sheldon are now very experienced with this so ask us if you have any questions or ever worry that you may mess up the game.
- If you mess something up, we can undo commits so communicate with others to figure out how to do that.
- Only commit changes to things you created such as an added script or gameobject. Don't commit changes to anything you didn't mean to change.
