Brandon Foss - Prefabs

These are the prefabs I created to implement a HUD system within our project. It contains all the required 
canvas materials and objects along with extra scripts tied to the end that can be taken and placed on
any ship to provide proper health tracking and display along with a functioning timer. Make sure to take the
extra scripts and apply them to the object you want to track. They will not function where they are.
